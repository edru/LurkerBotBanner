# LurkerBotBanner
A list of Twitch lurker bots with the eventual goal of creating a python script that could be used with Streamlabs Chatbot to have a command tied to it, which would execute the script, reference the list of lurker bots, and issue /ban commands per user in the list in your channel.

Due to Twitch not having any API commands to issue a ban, this is the only "automated" solution that comes to mind at the moment.

Currently I am resourcing https://twitchinsights.net/bots for the list - with the slight modification of removing the bots that users put into their channels on purpose (like Nightbot, Moobot, etc).
